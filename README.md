#### 1. Database Relationships

The Codeup `zillow` SQL database contains twelve tables, nine of which have foreign key links with our primary table `properties_2017`: `airconditioningtype`, `architecturalstyletype`, `buildingclasstype`, `heatingorsystemtype`, `predictions_2017`, `propertylandusetype`, `storytype`, `typeconstructiontype`, and `unique_properties`. Each table is connected by a pointed arrow with the corresponding foreign keys that link them. Many of these tables are unused in this project due to missing values, and this database map serves only to define the database.

#### 2. Data Dictionary

Following acquisition and preparation of the initial SQL database, the DataFrames used in this project contain the following variables. Contained values are defined along with their respective data types.

### V. Modules
---

The created modules used in this project below contain full comments an docstrings to better understand their operation. Where applicable, all functions used `random_state=19` at all times. Use of functions requiring access to the Codeup database require an additional module named `env.py`. See project reproduction for more detail.

- [`acquire`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-zapata/project_clustering_zillow/main/acquire.py): contains functions used in initial data acquisition leading into the prepare phase
- [`prepare`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-zapata/project_clustering_zillow/main/prepare.py): contains functions used to prepare data for exploration and visualization
- [`explore`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-zapata/project_clustering_zillow/main/explore.py): contains functions to visualize the prepared data and estimate the best drivers of property value
- [`wrangle`  ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-zapata/project_clustering_zillow/main/wrangle.py  ): contains functions to prepare data in the manner needed for specific Zillow needs
- [`model`  ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-zapata/project_clustering_zillow/main/model.py  ): contains functions to create, test models and visualize their performance

### VI. Project Reproduction
---

To recreate and reproduce results of this project, you will need to create a module named `env.py`. This file will need to contain login credentials for the Codeup database server stored in their respective variables named `host`, `username`, and `password`. You will also need to create the following function within. This is used in all functions that acquire data from the SQL server to create the URL for connecting. `db_name` needs to be passed as a string that matches exactly with the name of a database on the server.

```py
def get_connection(db_name):
    return f'mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@{host}/{db_name}'
```

After its creation, ensure this file is not uploaded or leaked by ensuring git does not interact with it. When using any function housed in the created modules above, ensure full reading of comments and docstrings to understand its proper use and passed arguments or parameters.
